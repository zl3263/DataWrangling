## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
a = read_csv("data_import_examples/FAS_litters.csv")
a = janitor::clean_names(a)
a
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(a)
```
'read.csv' options
```{r}
read.csv("data_import_examples/FAS_litters.csv", na=c("","NA",999), skip = 2)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r readexcel}
library(readxl)
mlbDf = read_excel("data_import_examples/mlb11.xlsx")
mlbDf
```
```{r}
lotr_words_df = 
  read_excel(
    "data_import_examples/LotR_Words.xlsx",
    range = "B3:D6"
  )
lotr_words_df
```



```{r}
library(haven)
pulseDf = read_sas('data_import_examples/public_pulse_data.sas7bdat')
pulseDf
```
